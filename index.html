    <h3>Our First Story About Winneba</h3>
    <p class="lead">According to Effutu oral history, they were among the first ethnic groups to settle in this region of the Gold Coast, arriving in Simpa prior to the Akans. Legend has it that the Effutu people migrated from Timbuktu (ancient Western Sudan Empire).
After the fall of the old Ghana Empire and the 14th‐century rise of Mali Empire, the Effutu people headed towards the south, traveling through the savanna and the rain forest to the coast, finally settling at Simpa. This journey was supposedly led by the war god Penkye Otu, who protected the ethnic group from all dangers.
To show their appreciation, the people consulted the custodian of the god in order to find a proper sacrifice. They wished that they had not, for to their astonishment, the god asked for a human sacrifice, someone from the royal family no less. This command was followed, for awhile at least. Not surprisingly, after some period of time the human sacrifice became unacceptable among the royal family, so a lion was substituted. This too was problematic as the animal was supposed to be caught alive and with bare hands. Finally, a deer or a kind of antelope was agreed to be used as sacrifice for the Penkye Otu.. </p>

          <h3>Independence</h3>
         <p>Following Ghana’s independence in 1957, the new nation’s first president, Kwame Nkruma, decided to transform a small, local college into an institute dedicated to the training of African nationalists from across the continent. While the Kwame Nkruma Ideological Institute only existed until Nkruma’s government was overthrown in 1968 an institute of higher learning still exists in Winneba. The University of Education, Winneba (UEW) was founded in 1992 with the primary purpose of teacher education and still occupies the academic complex that Nkruma so greatly enlarged. With a current student population of more than 40,000, UEW drastically increases Winneba’s population.</p>

         <h3>Transition</h3>
         <p>Economically, Winneba is a far cry from its heyday as an important port on the Gold Coast. Farming and fishing still play an important role but as the importance of the port has decreased the primacy of the service industry has increased. Although Winneba is, at its heart, still deeply connected to the history and culture of Effutu people, the population and power of other ethnic groups has increased. </p>
